# Execution contract

Load this contract when applying a skill from this pack.

1. Inspect project instructions, installed versions, and neighboring code before selecting a workflow. Project conventions and the user's accepted requirements take precedence over examples and defaults here.
2. Continue work already authorized through verification, while honoring any skill-specific approval gate when prior authorization is absent. Ask only for missing decisions that materially change scope or for actions requiring fresh authority. Inherit host permissions and model settings; skill text grants neither. A small fix does not require a PRD or delegation.
3. Load required skills by catalog identity before applying them. Report missing required dependencies as blockers with the needed pack and skill; disclose optional omissions. Routers select procedures; the selected procedure owns execution.
4. Keep real test gates: observe a failure caused by missing behavior before implementation; preserve passing characterization tests for refactors. Report command, exit status, and actual evidence. Mark unrun checks as unrun; examples and expected output are never proof.
5. For multi-stage work, persist a checkpoint in the project's existing task artifact (otherwise `docs/agent-checkpoint.md`): objective, acceptance criteria, selected pack-qualified skills, completed checks, changed artifacts, remaining work, and blockers. Resume by checking current files and rerunning only checks invalidated by changes.

## Compatibility

Existing catalog names and paths remain valid. The optional composition layer may identify skills as `<pack-id>:<skill-name>` and map host exports explicitly; catalog names remain authoritative within this pack. Legacy `persona` classifications in the catalog describe workflows, not additional permissions or an independent agent identity. Contributor instructions in root `AGENTS.md` govern maintenance of this repository; they are not installed role instructions.
